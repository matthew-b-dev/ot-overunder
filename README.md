- A game in the same vein as `moreorless`, except themed for "Official Threads" in enthusiast gaming forums.
- Player is given information about one Original Thread and its comment count
  - E.g. 'Baldur's Gate 3 has 31,305 comments'
- Player is given the name of another Original Thread, and is asked if this OT has MORE or LESS comments.
- Guessing correctly increments the score by 1
- Guessing incorrectly resets the score to 0
- Highscore is saved in browser local storage
